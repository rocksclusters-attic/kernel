Some good ideas for the near future:

	-- Create a driver installation script that works with a
	   pre-installed OS (i.e. install driver w/o anaconda);

	-- Facilitate building (S)RPMs for driver modules.

Some good ideas for farther out:

	-- Create "autorun" script so driver installation starts
	   automatically when CD is inserted (don't forget icon.xpm!);

	-- Integrate/cooperate w/ kudzu(-like) tool for automatic
	   installation of "correct" driver on pre-installed OS.
