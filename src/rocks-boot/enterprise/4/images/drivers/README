INTRODUCTION

Welcome to ddiskit! (pronounced dee-dis-kit)

The raison d'etre for ddiskit is to ease the burden (and encode
the magic) of making Device Driver Update Disks for Red Hat
originated distributions (i.e. RHEL and FC) based on the 2.6 (and
beyond?) series of Linux kernels.  ddiskit fills the same need which
Doug Ledford's Device Driver Update Disk Devel Kit (available at
http://people.redhat.com/dledford) filled for prior generations of
Red Hat distributions.

GETTING STARTED

The basic set of operations needed to adapt ddiskit for building
driver disks with your desired drivers looks like this:

	-- Modify the contents of the kversions file
	-- Modify the contents of the subdirs file
	-- Add a directory for the new driver being built
	-- Copy the sources for the new driver to that directory
	-- Copy the Makefiles from the tmpl directory to the new
	   driver's directory and modify them appropriately
	-- Type 'make' in the top-level directory
	-- Retrieve the dd.iso.gz file from the images directory

Several example drivers are provided.  New users are encouraged to
simply type 'make' in the top-level directory in order to fully enjoy
the out-of-box experience.

Note: ddiskit must be customized before it can generate Driver Update
Disk images appropriate for use with any Red Hat distribution.
