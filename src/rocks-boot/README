The following is for RedHat/CentOS 6

There are 4 file system images that are used during installation

1. initrd
	This is the standard initial ramdisk. Rocks brings up
lighttpd, rock-tracker

2. updates.img - this is created by rocks in the base roll in the updates.img.
This brings a large set of tools to create kickstart files

3. product.img - this has small number of python files that contain rocks 
patches to anaconda.

4. install.img - this is is created by the anaconda buildinstall script. The contents of this image are defined by each particular version of anaconda


Dissecting loader.  
Loader is the compiled program the begins execution only with files in initrd. 
It is charged with determining where the other img files are located (network, cd, harddisk), and the type installation to start It finds and loads the img files and generally "merges" some elements of the file system. 

updates.img is mounted on /tmp/updates
install.img is mounted on /mnt/runtime (in loader, this is called stage2)
product.img contents are compied to /tmp/product 

Once the images are mounted the following directory manipulations
(see loader.c)
            /usr, /lib, /lib64 a retargeted to /mnt/runtime/[usr,lib,lib64]
            this means that unloaded libs in initrd become unavailable. 
            --> may need some libs in both initrd and install.img

            contents of /tmp/mnt/runtime/[etc,var] are copied to the existing
            ones (from initrd)

            finally, /mnt/runtime/etc/selinux are copied to /etc/selinux. 
            if configured, selinux is started.
